Date: May 21, 2021 - March 2022

The modern age greatly depends on satellite technology. Global Positioning Systems (GPS), military communications, and astronomical observations would be impossible without it. 
This is why solar weather poses more of a risk than ever before. Solar flares are a phenomenon where the sun bursts out electromagnetic particles, particularly UV radiation and X-rays. 
If these flares hit the earth, they have the capacity to interact with satellite radio waves, causing disruptions within satellite systems. 
These distortions will inevitably lead to malfunctions in many satellite-dependent systems. In order to prepare for these blackouts, this project aims to utilize machine learning to predict occurrences of M-class and X-class solar flares. 
Data was taken from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) through the observations of Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES). 
Keras was used to perform machine learning on the datasets, with Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) being the main layers which built the neural network.
